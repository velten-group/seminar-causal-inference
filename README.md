## Seminar overview:
In this seminar, we will explore the fundamental ideas of causality: how we can reason about cause and effect beyond correlations. The focus will be on understanding basic principles, mathematical models, and modern approaches that connect causality with data-driven modeling.

## Organization:

- First meeting will take place on 10.11.2025, where we will give an introductory lecture on causality and its basic principles.
- Depending on the number of participants, we plan to meet 3–4 times during the semester (tentatively in KW50, KW51, KW3, and KW5).
- Presentations can be done in groups of 2 or 3, depending on the number of participants and chosen papers.
- Intended audience is Masters' (M,SC,P,DSC). Additionally, Proseminar and Bachelor’s seminar participation is possible. Please let us know your preference.
